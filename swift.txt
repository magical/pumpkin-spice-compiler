lessons from swift:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntj8ab-5cvE
- have an immediate IR between the ast and the low-level IR
- ssa-based
- high-level type information
- don't worry about machine representation yet
- basic blocks should take args (no phi nodes)
- have an explicit entry block
- have an op for creating literals
