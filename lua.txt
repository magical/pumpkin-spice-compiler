good ideas from lua:
- expressions are not allowed to be statements; only function calls can be statements on their own
- (maybe) return only allowed at end of block
- very simple grammar
- not many built-in language features
- automatic conversion of integers to strings in concatenation
- multiple return values
- coroutines

bad ideas from lua:
- implicit variable declaration; undefined variables evaluating to nil
- newline is not a statement terminator
- no trailing commas allowed
- no augmented assignment operators
- floats are the only numeric type (should be bigints)
- tables as the only data type; no lists
- automatic coercion between types
- repeat-until loops
- inequality operator is ~= instead of !=
